Here is the guide to install Docker and build Polymer image in your local machine. 
After you build your own image, you can run the script to process SEN3 satellite image.

Step 1 Install Docker engine on your computer.

Please refer Docker website for installation. 

https://docs.docker.com/install/
 
Step 2 setup.

Please download Dockerfile from GitHub and save it to a folder. For example “SENG370”

Except for Docker file, there are two more files.  One is polymer-v4.9.tar.gz and one is test1.py. Please save them to SENG370 folder as well.

You can replace test1.py with your script if you want. Just remember to change Dockerfile. 

Step 3 build Docker polymer images.

Open a terminal and cd to SENG370 folder. Run below command.
The command is : “ sudo  docker build -t polymer .” 

Please note the -t tells docker engine the name of your container. You can change to any string. 
Also, the dot is mandatory.

Step4 initial a Docker container instance

“sudo docker run -v “/home/gaobing/sing_workdir/docker_example/raw_file”:/raw_file -it --entrypoint /bin/bash  polymer ” 

-v  bind you host directory to the container directory. 
As I put SNE3 raw file under  “/home/gaobing/sing_workdir/docker_example/raw_file”. After bind this directory to the container, you can see these file when you log in to the container

gaobing@gaobing-ycLab:~/sing_workdir/docker_example/raw_file$ ls -l
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 gaobing gaobing 4096 Feb 26 16:31 outdir1
drwxrwxr-x 2 gaobing gaobing 4096 Feb 26 15:04 S3A_OL_1_EFR____20180902T183108_20180902T183408_20180904T001910_0179_035_184_1980_MAR_O_NT_002.SEN3
drwxrwxr-x 2 gaobing gaobing 4096 Feb 26 15:04 S3A_OL_1_EFR____20180902T183408_20180902T183708_20180904T001954_0179_035_184_2160_MAR_O_NT_002.SEN3


when you bind it to container,you can see it 

root@67f07d5fb5fd:/raw_file# ls -l 
total 12
drwxrwxr-x 2 1000 1000 4096 Feb 26 23:04 S3A_OL_1_EFR____20180902T183108_20180902T183408_20180904T001910_0179_035_184_1980_MAR_O_NT_002.SEN3
drwxrwxr-x 2 1000 1000 4096 Feb 26 23:04 S3A_OL_1_EFR____20180902T183408_20180902T183708_20180904T001954_0179_035_184_2160_MAR_O_NT_002.SEN3
drwxr-xr-x 2 1000 1000 4096 Feb 27 00:56 outdir1

Last step execute the script
cd to directory pol4.9 and type command "python3 test1.py"

If you want to open the raw images and polymer output files, you can use ESA SNAP tool. You can download from below link and install on your computer
